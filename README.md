## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Kubernetes cluster (Kind for local, EKS for production)
- Helm 3.8+
- kubectl
- Docker
- Python 3.9.7+

### Quick Start: Local Deployment

```bash
# 1. Initialize configuration (select your use case)
./init.sh

# 2. Setup Kind cluster and get images
./setup.sh              # Pull release images (default)
./setup.sh -d           # Build images locally (dev mode)
./setup.sh -y           # Non-interactive, pull release images
./setup.sh -y -d        # Non-interactive, build locally
./setup.sh -y --clean   # Clean install with release images
./setup.sh -y -d --clean # Clean install, build locally

# 3. Deploy Darwin platform to Kubernetes
./start.sh
```

#### Choosing Your Use Case

By default, `init.sh` offers two simplified presets:

| Preset | Features | Use Case |
|--------|----------|----------|
| **Training** | Compute + MLFlow | Model training, experiments, distributed compute with Ray clusters |
| **Inference** | Serve + MLFlow | Model deployment, real-time inference endpoints |

You can select one or both presets. Dependencies are automatically resolved.

#### Advanced: Granular Service Selection

For fine-grained control over individual services, use **dev mode**:

```bash
./init.sh --dev-mode
```

This enables the original service-by-service selection:

| If you want to... | Enable |
|-------------------|--------|
| Run distributed data processing jobs or spin up short-lived compute clusters | **Compute** |
| Work interactively with persistent code and notebooks attached to scalable clusters | **Workspace** (includes Compute) |
| Store, version, and serve features for ML training and inference | **Feature Store** |
| Track experiments, log metrics, and manage model versions | **MLflow** |
| Deploy trained models as real-time inference endpoints | **Serve** (includes Artifact Builder) |
| Discover and track lineage across datasets, models, and pipelines | **Catalog** |
| Capture platform events and build metadata graphs | **Chronos** |
| Orchestrate multi-step ML pipelines with scheduling and dependencies | **Workflow** (includes Compute, Airflow) |

> **Tip**: Dependencies are resolved automatically. For example, enabling **Workspace** will also enable **Compute**, and enabling **Serve** will include **Artifact Builder** and **MLflow**.

### Quick Start: Create and Use a Ray Cluster

```bash
# Create a cluster via REST API
curl --location 'http://localhost/compute/cluster' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data-raw '{
    "cluster_name": "my-first-cluster",
    "tags": ["demo"],
    "runtime": "0.0",
    "inactive_time": 30,
    "start_cluster": true,
    "head_node_config": {
        "cores": 4,
        "memory": 8,
        "node_capacity_type": "ondemand"
    },
    "worker_node_configs": [
        {
            "cores_per_pods": 2,
            "memory_per_pods": 4,
            "min_pods": 1,
            "max_pods": 2,
            "disk_setting": null,
            "node_capacity_type": "ondemand"
        }
    ],
    "user": "user@example.com"
}'

# Wait for Cluster to become Active
curl http://localhost/compute/cluster/{cluster_id}/metadata
# Wait until the status shows active.

# Response will include cluster_id
# Get Cluster Dashboards link via below API using cluster_id
curl --location 'http://localhost/compute/cluster/{cluster_id}/dashboards'
# Access Jupyter notebook at the returned jupyter_lab_url
# Monitor Ray cluster at the ray_dashboard_url

# Stop the cluster when done
curl --location --request POST 'http://localhost/compute/cluster/stop-cluster/{cluster_id}' \
  --header 'msd-user: {"email": "user@example.com"}'
```

**Understanding Runtime Parameter:**

The `runtime` field specifies which pre-built Docker image to use for your Ray cluster. Darwin supports multiple runtimes with different Python versions and pre-installed libraries:

- `"0.0"`: Default runtime with Ray 2.37.0, Python 3.10, Spark 3.5.1, and darwin-sdk
- Custom runtimes can be registered with specific library combinations

To check available runtimes:
```bash
curl http://localhost/compute/get-runtimes | python3 -m json.tool
```

**Or use the Python SDK:**

```python
# Install SDK
pip install -e darwin-compute/sdk

# Create a cluster
from darwin_compute import ComputeCluster

cluster = ComputeCluster(env="darwin-local")
response = cluster.create_with_yaml("examples/cluster-config.yaml")
cluster_id = response['cluster_id']

# Check and wait until cluster status becomes active
cluster.get_info(cluster_id)

# Stop when done
cluster.stop(cluster_id)
```

### Quick Start: Deploy a Model

```bash
# Activate Darwin CLI
source .venv/bin/activate

# 1. Configure Darwin CLI
darwin config set --env darwin-local

# 2. Configure Serve authentication (uses default token for darwin-local)
darwin serve configure

# 3. Create environment
darwin serve environment create --name local --domain-suffix .local --cluster-name kind

# 4. Create serve
darwin serve create \
  --name iris-classifier \
  --type api \
  --space serve \
  --description "Iris classification model"

# 5. Deploy model
darwin serve deploy-model \
  --serve-name iris-classifier \
  --artifact-version v1 \
  --model-uri mlflow-artifacts:/1/2b2b1b5727a14c5ca81b44e899979745/artifacts/model \
  --cores 2 \
  --memory 4 \
  --node-capacity spot \
  --min-replicas 1 \
  --max-replicas 2

# 6. Make predictions
curl -X POST http://localhost/iris-classifier/predict \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"features": [[5.1, 3.5, 1.4, 0.2]]}'
```

## 🎯 Quick Start: Submit a Spark Job Using Darwin SDK

Darwin SDK provides seamless integration with Apache Spark on Ray clusters. Here's how to run distributed Spark workloads using Darwin as your Spark session provider:

### Step 1: Create a Ray Cluster

```bash
curl --location 'http://localhost/compute/cluster' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data-raw '{
    "cluster_name": "spark-demo-cluster",
    "tags": ["spark", "demo"],
    "runtime": "0.0",
    "inactive_time": 60,
    "start_cluster": true,
    "head_node_config": {
        "cores": 4,
        "memory": 8,
        "node_capacity_type": "ondemand"
    },
    "worker_node_configs": [{
        "cores_per_pods": 2,
        "memory_per_pods": 4,
        "min_pods": 1,
        "max_pods": 2,
        "disk_setting": null,
        "node_capacity_type": "ondemand"
    }],
    "user": "user@example.com"
}'
```

Save the `cluster_id` from the response.

### Step 2: Wait for Cluster to be Ready

```bash
# Check cluster status
curl http://localhost/compute/cluster/{cluster_id}/metadata

# Wait until status shows "active"
# Then verify pods are running
kubectl get pods -n ray -l ray.io/cluster={cluster_id}-kuberay
```

### Step 3: Create Your Spark Job

Create a file `my_spark_job.py`:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""
Darwin SDK Spark Job Example
"""
import os
import ray

# Initialize Ray (connects to running Ray cluster)
ray.init()

# Set environment variables
os.environ["ENV"] = "LOCAL"
os.environ["CLUSTER_ID"] = os.getenv("CLUSTER_ID", "your-cluster-id")
os.environ["DARWIN_COMPUTE_URL"] = "http://darwin-compute.darwin.svc.cluster.local:8000"

print("=" * 60)
print("Darwin SDK Spark Job")
print(f"Cluster ID: {os.environ['CLUSTER_ID']}")
print("=" * 60)

# Initialize Spark using darwin-sdk
from darwin import init_spark_with_configs

spark_configs = {
    "spark.sql.execution.arrow.pyspark.enabled": "true",
    "spark.sql.session.timeZone": "UTC",
    "spark.sql.shuffle.partitions": "10",
    "spark.default.parallelism": "10",
    "spark.driver.memory": "1g",
    "spark.executor.memory": "1g",
}

spark = init_spark_with_configs(spark_configs=spark_configs)
print(f"✓ Spark initialized (version: {spark.version})")

# Create and process DataFrame
df = spark.createDataFrame([
    (1, "Alice", 100),
    (2, "Bob", 200),
    (3, "Charlie", 300),
], ["id", "name", "score"])

print("\nDataFrame Contents:")
df.show()

print(f"\nTotal records: {df.count()}")
print(f"Average score: {df.agg({'score': 'avg'}).collect()[0][0]}")

# Stop Spark cleanly
from darwin import stop_spark
stop_spark()

print("\n✓ Job completed successfully!")
```

### Step 4: Submit the Job

**Option A: Using submit_spark_job.sh Script**

```bash
cd darwin-sdk/darwin
./submit_spark_job.sh \
  --cluster-name {cluster_id} \
  --namespace ray \
  --job-file /path/to/my_spark_job.py \
  --wait
```

**Option B: Using Ray Jobs API**

```bash
# Port-forward to Ray dashboard
kubectl port-forward -n ray svc/{cluster_id}-kuberay-head-svc 8265:8265 &

# Submit job
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8265/api/jobs/" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "entrypoint": "python my_spark_job.py",
    "runtime_env": {
      "working_dir": "./",
      "env_vars": {
        "CLUSTER_ID": "'{cluster_id}'",
        "ENV": "LOCAL"
      }
    },
    "metadata": {
      "name": "darwin-spark-demo"
    }
  }'
```

**Option C: Using Ray Python Client**

```python
from ray.job_submission import JobSubmissionClient

client = JobSubmissionClient("http://localhost:8265")

job_id = client.submit_job(
    entrypoint="python my_spark_job.py",
    runtime_env={
        "working_dir": "./",
        "env_vars": {
            "CLUSTER_ID": "{cluster_id}",
            "ENV": "LOCAL"
        }
    }
)

print(f"Submitted job: {job_id}")

# Wait for completion
client.wait_until_status(job_id, "SUCCEEDED")
print(client.get_job_logs(job_id))
```

### Step 5: Monitor Job Execution

```bash
# Check job status
SUBMISSION_ID="raysubmit_xxxxxxxx"
curl "http://localhost:8265/api/jobs/${SUBMISSION_ID}"

# View job logs
curl "http://localhost:8265/api/jobs/${SUBMISSION_ID}/logs"

# Or use Ray Dashboard
open http://localhost:8265
```

### Darwin SDK Spark Functions

| Function | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `init_spark_with_configs(spark_configs)` | Initialize Spark with custom configurations |
| `start_spark(spark_conf)` | Start Spark with default Glue catalog configs |
| `get_raydp_spark_session()` | Get existing Spark session |
| `stop_spark()` | Stop Spark session cleanly |

### Troubleshooting

**Issue: "Runtime given is incorrect"**
```bash
# Check available runtimes
curl http://localhost/compute/get-runtimes
```

**Issue: Ray job stuck in PENDING**
```bash
# Check Ray head pod
kubectl describe pod {cluster_id}-kuberay-head-xxx -n ray
```

**Issue: Connection refused when submitting job**
```bash
# Restart port-forward
pkill -f "port-forward.*8265"
kubectl port-forward -n ray svc/{cluster_id}-kuberay-head-svc 8265:8265 &
```

**Issue: Cluster not starting due to long init script**

If your `init_script` in the cluster configuration is too long, the cluster may fail to start. This happens because init scripts are executed during pod startup and have timeout limitations.

**Solutions:**
- Use the **Library Installation API** to install packages instead of init scripts
- Create a **custom runtime** with your dependencies pre-installed
- Split long scripts into smaller, essential commands

    "worker_node_configs": [
        {
            "cores": 2,
            "memory": 4,
            "min_pods": 1,
            "max_pods": 2
        }
    ],
    "user": "user@example.com"
}'
```

Save the `cluster_id` from the response - you'll need it for the next steps.

### 📊 2) Check Status

Check your cluster status:

```bash
curl http://localhost/compute/cluster/{cluster_id}/metadata
```

**Wait until the status shows active.**

### 📓 3) Open Jupyter Notebook

Once the cluster is ready, access the Jupyter notebook at:

```
http://localhost/kind-0/{cluster_id}-jupyter
```

Open this URL in your browser to start working in the workspace.

### 🏡 4) Copy and Run Example: housing-prices

In the Jupyter notebook, copy the example project: /examples/housing-prices/ in Jupyter notebook. The model will be logged automatically to MLflow.

### 🏷️ 5) Check Your Model in the Registry

Verify your trained model in the Darwin MLflow UI:

```
http://localhost/mlflow-app/experiments
```

Navigate to your experiment to see the registered model with metrics and parameters.

### 🚀 6) Deploy with Darwin CLI

Deploy your trained model (replace `<experiment_id>` and `<run_id>` with values from MLflow UI):

> **📖 Sample training script for house price prediction: [examples/house-price-prediction/train_house_pricing_model.ipynb](examples/house-price-prediction/train_house_pricing_model.ipynb)**

```bash
# Activate Darwin CLI
source .venv/bin/activate

# 1. Configure Darwin CLI (one-time)
darwin config set --env darwin-local
darwin serve configure

# 2. Create environment
darwin serve environment create --name local --domain-suffix .local --cluster-name kind

# 3. Create serve
darwin serve create \
  --name housing-model \
  --type api \
  --space serve \
  --description "House Price Prediction model"

# 4. Deploy model
darwin serve deploy-model \
  --serve-name housing-model \
  --artifact-version v1 \
  --model-uri mlflow-artifacts:/1/<experiment_id>/<run_id>/artifacts/model \
  --cores 2 \
  --memory 4 \
  --node-capacity spot \
  --min-replicas 1 \
  --max-replicas 2
```

> **📖 For complete Serve CLI documentation, see [darwin-cli/README.md#serve-commands](darwin-cli/README.md#serve-commands)**

### 🌐 7) Test Your Endpoint

Test your deployed model:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost/housing-model/predict \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "features": {
      "MedInc": 3.5214,
      "HouseAge": 15.0,
      "AveRooms": 6.575757575757576,
      "AveBedrms": 1.0196969696969697,
      "Population": 1447.0,
      "AveOccup": 3.0144927536231883,
      "Latitude": 37.63,
      "Longitude": -122.43
    }
  }'
```

Once deployed, your model is accessible as a real-time inference API.

## 🔧 Configuration

Darwin uses a declarative configuration approach:

### Service Selection (`init.sh`)
Interactive wizard to select platform components:

**Default Mode** - Simplified preset selection:
```bash
./init.sh
# Prompts for:
# - Training preset (Compute + MLFlow)
# - Inference preset (Serve + MLFlow)
```

**Dev Mode** - Granular service-by-service selection:
```bash
./init.sh --dev-mode
# Prompts for enabling individual:
# - Applications (Compute, Feature Store, MLflow, etc.)
# - Datastores (MySQL, Cassandra, Kafka, etc.)
# - Ray images and Serve runtimes
```

**All Mode** - Enable everything:
```bash
./init.sh --all
# Enables all services without prompts
```

Generates `.setup/enabled-services.yaml` with user selections.

### Environment Variables
Key configuration via `.setup/config.env` (auto-generated):
```bash
KUBECONFIG=./.setup/kindkubeconfig.yaml
DOCKER_REGISTRY=127.0.0.1:32768
```

### Helm Values
Customize deployments via `helm/darwin/values.yaml`:
```yaml
global:
  namespace: darwin
  
services:
  compute:
    enabled: true
    replicas: 2
  
datastores:
  mysql:
    enabled: true
  cassandra:
    enabled: true
```

## 🧩 Extensibility

### Available Runtimes

Darwin provides pre-built Ray runtimes for cluster creation. The **Runtime Name** is what you pass to the API when creating clusters (e.g., `"runtime": "0.1"`).

| Runtime Name | Image | Ray Version | Python | Class | Type |
|--------------|-------|-------------|--------|-------|------|
| 0.0 | ray:2.37.0 | 2.37.0 | 3.10 | CPU | Ray Only |
| 0.1 | ray:2.53.0 | 2.53.0 | 3.10 | CPU | Ray Only |

### Custom Runtimes
Add new Ray runtimes by creating Dockerfiles in `darwin-compute/runtimes/`:
```dockerfile
# darwin-compute/runtimes/cpu/Ray2.37_Py3.11_CustomLibs/Dockerfile
FROM rayproject/ray:2.37.0-py311
RUN pip install jupyterlab==4.3.0
RUN pip install custom-library
```

Register in `services.yaml`:
```yaml
ray-images:
  - image-name: ray:2.37.0-py311-custom
    dockerfile-path: darwin-compute/runtimes/cpu/Ray2.37_Py3.11_CustomLibs
```

### Custom Transformers (Chronos)
Create Python transformers for event processing:
```python
# Chronos transformer
def transform(event):
    return {
        "event_type": "cluster_created",
        "entities": [{"type": "cluster", "id": event["cluster_id"]}],
        "relationships": [{"from": user, "to": cluster, "type": "owns"}]
    }
```
